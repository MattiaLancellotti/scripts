## My scripts
### Introduction
This repository stores a collection of scripts that I created and actively use
to automate parts of my workflow or just having fun (I do enjoy writing shell
scripts). I also like to change my writing style so expect some changes often.

### Scripts

### Installation
Manual installation as of now. Planning to create an install.sh that dictates
installation rules.
